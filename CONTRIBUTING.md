## First time Contributor

To get an idea of the app, feel free to check out the [website](https://threadify.vercel.app/)

A good place to start would be our list of [good first issues](https://github.com/pushkaraj2007/Threadify/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)

## I Want To Contribute

- Always check for [existing issues](https://github.com/pushkaraj2007/Threadify/issues) before creating a new issue.
- Only start working on an issue if it has been assigned to you. This avoids multiple PRs for the same issue.
- Every change in this project must have an associated issue. **Issue before PR**

### Legal Notice

> When contributing to this project, you must agree that you have authored 100% of the content, that you have the necessary rights to the content and that the content you contribute may be provided under the project license.

To start contributing to this project, follow the steps below.

### Fork the Project

- Fork this repository. This will create a local copy of this repository on your github profile.

  <a href='https://postimages.org/' target='_blank'><img src='https://i.postimg.cc/J4pdgJZH/Screenshot-2022-10-10-at-18-51-49.png' border='0' alt='Fork Repository'/></a>

- Now clone the forked repository on your local machine

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Threadify.git
  ```

- Keep a reference to the original project in `upstream` remote.

  ```bash
  cd Threadify
  git remote add upstream https://github.com/pushkaraj2007/Threadify.git
  ```

- If you have created the fork a while ago, synchronize your copy before working.

  ```bash
  git remote update
  git checkout -b main
  git rebase upstream/main
  ```

### Create a new branch

Creating a new branch lets you work on your issue without creating merge conflicts while making PRs.
Select a name for your branch that is in line with the issue you are addressing.

```bash
# It will create a new branch with name branch_name and switch to that branch
git checkout -b branch_name
```

### Set environment variables

So after setting the upstream branch and creating a new branch, create a `.env` file into the root of your project and add the environment variables.

**What are environment variables?**

These are the variables that a project or a microservice needs to work around some functionalities which contains some token or secret code which is generated by the developer indivdually.

So, these are the environment variables that this project is using:

```env
# MONGO_URI is a mongoDB url that is required for database
MONGO_URI

GITHUB_USER # github username
GITHUB_API_KEY # github API key

# these credentials are required for sending email
MY_EMAIL # email address
MY_PASSWORD # email's app password

# Twitter client ID and client Secret to get access to the twitter
TWITTER_CLIENT_ID
TWITTER_CLIENT_SECRET
BEARER_TOKEN

# This env is for NextJS Authentication
NEXTAUTH_SECRET
```

### Work on the issue assigned

- Work on the issue assigned to you.
- Add all the files/folders needed.
- After you've made your contribution to the project add changes to the branch you've just created:

```bash
# To add all new files to branch branch_name
git add .

# To add only a few files to branch_name
git add <names of files changed or added>
```

### Commit

- To commit this change, give a descriptive message for the convenience of reviewer

```bash
# This message will be associated with all files you have changed
git commit -m "message"
```

### Work Remotely

```bash
# To push your work to your remote repository
git push -u origin branch_name
```

### Pull Request

Go to your repository in the browser and click on compare and pull requests.
This will send a request to the maintainer to add your contribution to the main repository `https://github.com/pushkaraj2007/Threadify.git`

<br/>

Add a title to your Pull Request.

<br/>

Make sure to mention which issue is solved with this Pull Request by mentioning the issue number #. Then add a description to your Pull Request that explains your contribution.
